# GRAINS Mozzi Simple Example (Triangle Wave) 
  
a minimalistic Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves, using the Mozzi library: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi

The intention of this Firmware is to provide a very basic sketch to build upon if you want to develop your own firmware using Mozzi sketches
    
To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS
To include the Mozzi library with your sketch please also refer to "Installation" at https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi.
Documentation on Mozzi can be found here: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html
