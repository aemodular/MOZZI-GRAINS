If you own the current revision of GRAINS, please make sure to set the __Mode-Switch to 'M'__ to use any of the Firmwares available for download here. This Mode-Switch selects the internal audio-out pin, 'M' is needed for 'Mozzi mode', whereas 'G' is for 'Ginkosynthese / original Grains mode', in connection with different firmwares available at the link mentioned obove.

List of Firmwares
==================
__For more details on the individual firmwares, please refer to the equivalent README-files that come with them.__

__Tutorial__                                                               
This folder contains a series of tutorial projects which start as simple as possible and will get gradually more complex. If you want to learn how to program your own sounds with GRAINS and the MOZZI Library, please start here.  

__Mozzi-GRAINS LFOs++__  
Variable Waveform + Squarewave with crossmodulation, Envelope, WhiteNoise, Random generator  
The intention of this Firmware is to provide two LFOs with various options (including very slow speeds) especially useful for generative patches

__Mozzi-GRAINS Krachmacher__  
Two streams of noise-impulses get mixed in different manners, resulting in all kinds of sounds from pulsating sequences to static soundscapes to feedback-screams.
Along with the Karplus-Strong inspired soundgeneration there is also a VCF and VCA build in that can be routed in different ways. Noise-sources can be switched, too.

__Mozzi-GRAINS Stradella__  
The intention of this Firmware is to provide chords, laid down over 3-4 octaves in a similar order as with the chord-buttons on an accordeon, hence the name.
A fourth note can also be added. The basetone of the chords and the fourth note can be transposed by +-12 notes. Several soundoptions (Saw, Triangle, Sinus, Square, distorted Saw) are available. CV-input via IN-3 is required to play the chords.
