# 'Mozzi-GRAINS Stradella'
 
an experimental Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves, using the Mozzi library: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi
The intention of this Firmware is to provide chords, laid down over 5 octaves in a similar order as with the chord-buttons on an accordeon, hence the name
   
To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS
To include the Mozzi library with your sketch please also refer to "Installation" at https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi.
Documentation on Mozzi can be found here: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html

This sketch is ment to provide a simple, chord-based polyphonic module, any of the chords are playable with only one key via CV over IN-3
We are using the so called Stradella system as to be found on accordions to provide our chords
1) C-E-G (C major), 2) G-Eb-C (C minor), 3) Bb-E-C (C dominant 7th) 4) Eb-C-A (C diminished 7th) and on some instruments 5) C-E-G# (C augmented triad)
Main CV will used to define the basetone of the chord, the octave will decide which type of chords to use
All chords will be in a kind of center range, to be generally usable
To be able to use all chords, be sure to set the +2 Octaves switch to 'on' and turn the Pitch knob all way left
Of course there may be applications where deviation from that rule would be the right thing, though.

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Mode-Switch__

 * G/M Switch has to be set to 'M' to make GRAINS work properly with this Mozzi based sketch!
 
__Inputs__
 
* IN1 / Pot1: Tuning of the chord's base-notes, +- 12 notes (one octave) Middle position would be "center-C"
* IN2 / Pot2: Select an optional 4th note: +- 12 notes, relative to current setting of the chord-base note
* IN3:        CV-in to play chords, mapped to notes over 4 1/2 octaves
* Pot3:       Select the audio-character of the output: 0-position: "phase/strings"...
* A:          Gate for Note-4 (as set via IN2/Pot2 and IN1/Pot1) - note will play if either gate is open or trigger toggled it
* D:          Toggle-trigger for Note-4 (as set via IN2/Pot2 and IN1/Pot1) - note will play if either gate is open or trigger toggled it
              Hint: Gate (via audio-in) will not turn the note off, if the toggle (via 'D') still has set it to active!
              (Please note: 'D' is situated on the right side and would normally be used as an input!)              
__Outputs__

* OUT:        Sound output


__Patching and settings suggestions__

* Play chords via MIDI-notes
* Play chords via SEQ8 or SEQ16, trigger 4th note of Chord via toggle or gate from TOPOGRAF or TRIQ164
* Generate chord-sequences using two LFOs and S&H - one LFO providing the pitches via a triangle, the other LFO selecting the steps via a rectangle
* Try using QUANTIZER to narrow down the number of useful combinations with the setting described above
* Change the pitch of the forth note via CV-in via a sequencer in any of the scenarios above
* Change the envelope of the sound output by "Stradella" by 2VCA, driven by 2ENV or ADSR. 2ENV/ADSR should be triggered by the same event as the chords
* Change the sound of Stradella using a filter, DELAY, MULTIFX and so on
* Use Stradella rhythmically played through LOPAG, instead of filters/VCAs. LOPAG should be triggered by the same event and maybe even the CV as the chords  
* Try using WAVEFOLDER, especially with percussive settings as mentioned above
