  'Lesson 01 Simple Oscillator' (Triangle Wave) 
  a minimalistic Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves, using the Mozzi library: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi

  The intention of this Firmware is to provide a very basic sketch to build upon if you want to develop your own firmware using Mozzi sketches
    
  To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS
  To include the Mozzi library with your sketch please also refer to "Installation" at https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi.
  Documentation on Mozzi can be found here: https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/doc/html/index.html
  
  Demotrack available here: https://soundcloud.com/taitekatto/mozzi-simple-example-triangle-wave
  
  Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:
  Switch 'G'/'M' has to be set to 'M' to work properly with Mozzi based sketches
  ==============================================================================
  IN1 / Pot1: Change frequency of Oscillator
  IN2 / Pot2: [n/a]
  IN3:        [n/a]
  Pot3:       [n/a]
  A:          [n/a]
  
  OUT:        Audio out
  D:          [n/a]

  Notes:
  ------
  Caution! Use at your own risk (according to GNU General Public License '16. Limitation of Liability')
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  This program in combination with the hardware it is applied to can produce harsh and loud frequencies that may be of harm to speakers or your ears!
  Permanent hearing loss may result from exposure to sound at high volumes. Use as low a volume as possible.
